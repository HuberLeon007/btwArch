# btwArch

btwArch is a custom mechanical macropad designed because I use Arch btw. This hackpad features a sleek design with customizable keys, RGB lighting, and modern connectivity options to enhance your workflow.

Built as part of the HackClub 2025 initiative, this project serves as both a functional tool and a learning experience in PCB design, 3D modeling, and firmware development.    
(It was my first HackClub <3)

## Overall Design:
Here's the complete assembled btwArch showing the final product in action:

*The finished btwArch ready for daily use*

## CAD Model & Case Design:
The case features a modern, minimalist design with precise tolerances for perfect component fit. The assembly uses standard hardware for easy manufacturing and repair.

## PCB Design
The PCB was designed with modern best practices, featuring proper ground planes, optimized routing, and robust component placement.

## Firmware Overview
btwArch runs on KMK firmware, a powerful and flexible keyboard firmware that allows for extensive customization and macro programming.

**Features:**
- Customizable key macros via KMK
- RGB lighting effects and patterns
